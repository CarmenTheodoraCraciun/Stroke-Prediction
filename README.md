# Stroke Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains machine learning models and data related to stroke prediction. Stroke is a serious medical condition that occurs when blood flow to the brain is disrupted, leading to brain cell damage. Predicting stroke risk is crucial for early intervention and prevention.

## Contents
- **Data**: The data directory includes datasets used for training and evaluating the models.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb) demonstrate data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Models**: Trained machine learning models (logistic regression, random forests) are stored here.
- **Results**: Summary of model performance metrics and visualizations.
